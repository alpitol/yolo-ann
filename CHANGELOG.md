# 2026-10-07, v0.3.0
This release fixes exports and imports and makes loading more forgiving.

Added:
* COCO annotations can be loaded without a classes file: the class list is filled from the json's categories.
* The backup saves the class list too, so Restore only needs the images.
* Files that aren't class lists (COCO json, YOLO labels, ...) are refused by the Classes picker, with a hint
  to use Bboxes instead.
* Warnings for skipped data: boxes of images or classes that aren't loaded, images that fail to decode,
  unreadable annotation files.
* Unit tests for reading and writing annotation files (`tests/`).
* A progress bar and counter under Images while the selected images are read.

Changed:
* The canvas follows window resizes and browser zoom, and stays sharp after zooming in.
* A new box can be drawn while another one is selected; pressing inside a box selects it.
* Hints next to Classes and Restore; Save YOLO and Save COCO share a row; the side panel scrolls when needed.
* The image details and the box details share one line under the image list.
* The sidebar can be resized by dragging its border (double-click resets it); the width is remembered.
* A malformed VOC file adds none of its boxes. `.csv` class files are no longer offered (they were never read).
* Annotation file parsing and export moved into `formats.js`.

Fixed:
* Save YOLO/VOC/COCO and Crop&Save did nothing if the boxes referred to an image that isn't loaded.
* COCO import could put boxes on the wrong image, or stop at an annotation of an unloaded image.
* COCO annotations whose `file_name` includes a folder were not matched.
* Exported boxes are clipped to the image; VOC text is escaped and coordinates are integers.
* YOLO labels are read without rounding and tolerate extra spaces; blank rows in a classes file no longer shift ids.
* Annotation zips with folders, and upper-case file extensions, load correctly.
* Switching images quickly or loading a new image set no longer shows the wrong image.
* One image that fails to decode no longer stops the rest from loading.
* Delete and arrow keys no longer act on boxes and images while typing in a text field.
* Delete no longer removes a box that was already deselected.
* Image names with `&` and other special characters work in the image list.
* Ctrl+click on the selected image or class no longer breaks the arrow keys.
* The canvas redraws after Restore and after loading annotations, even if some files fail.
* Loading hundreds of images, annotation files, or Crop&Save no longer opens every file at once, which could
  freeze the browser (especially Flatpak/Snap browsers or with an on-access virus scanner). Files are read four
  at a time, and Crop&Save releases each decoded image when its crops are done.
